# Multiple Choice Question

What would the output of this code snippet be:

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;

class QuizExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2015, 10, 21);

        System.out.println(date.getMonth()); 
    }
}
```

## Incorrect

10

> Not quite. The `getMonth()` method actually returns the enum `Month` as a
> `String` value.

## Incorrect

9

> Not quite. The Legacy Date API started its months off 0, instead of 1 but the
> new Date and Time API will return the proper month number as we know it.
> Also, the `getMonth()` method will actually return the `Month` enum as a
> `String` value.

## Correct

OCTOBER

> Correct! The `date.getMonth()` method returns the enum `Month` as a `String`
> value.

## Incorrect

NOVEMBER

> Not quite. The Legacy Date API had the months off when trying to retrieve the
> month.
