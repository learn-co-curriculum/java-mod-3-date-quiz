# Multiple Choice Question

What would the output of this code snippet be:

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.format.ResolverStyle;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;

class QuizExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("MM-dd-uuuu").withResolverStyle(ResolverStyle.STRICT);

        String date = "02-29-2022";
        LocalDate localDate = LocalDate.parse(date, formatter);
        System.out.println(localDate);
    }
}
```

## Incorrect

2022-03-01

> Not quite. Take a look at the `ResolverStyle`. If the `ResolverStyle` was set
> to `ResolverStyle.LENIENT`, then this would be the answer.

## Incorrect

2022-02-28

> Not quite. Take a look at the `ResolverStyle`. If the `ResolverStyle` was set
> to `ResolverStyle.SMART`, then this would be the answer.

## Incorrect

2022-02-29

> Not quite. We have a `ResolverStyle` to help validate if this is a real date.
> And this date does not exist as 2022 was not a leap year.

## Correct

DateTimeParseException is thrown

> Correct! Since we have a `ResolverStyle` and the `ResolverStyle` was set to
> `ResolverStyle.STRICT`, this would mean Java will not correct the date if it
> is invalid. Since the date does not exist, it will throw a
> `DateTimeParseException` like so:
> Exception in thread "main" java.time.format.DateTimeParseException: Text
> '02-29-2022' could not be parsed: Invalid date 'February 29' as '2022' is not
> a leap year
